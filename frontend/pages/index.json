We first collaborated on a research project tackling 3D image reconstruction with multiple GANs architectures - not an easy problem, but he had this knack for breaking it down into manageable parts when the rest of us were getting stuck. We later teamed up for a hackathon where his quick thinking saved us countless hours. Most recently, we were colleagues at Quidich Innovation Labs, where I got to see his work ethic day-to-day. What stands out about Yatharth isn't just his technical skills but he takes an extra mile to make things better - whether it's streamlining a workflow or pushing a project to the next level. Great teammate, sharp mind, and someone I'd gladly work with again.",
